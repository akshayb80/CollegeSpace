Barclays had visited the Campus for Internship hiring in November 2019. There was one<br/>
Technical Round and one HR Round after Selection from the Online Test.<br/>
Only Computer and IT Branch were allowed for appearing in the Online Test.<br/>
Round 1: Online Test<br/>
Online Test was Conducted on HackerEarth Platform.<br/>
There were two sections: Aptitude(Technical MCQs) and Coding Round.<br/>
Aptitude(Technical): Major part of this section had questions based on SQL Queries, JAVA<br/>
Programming and Data Structures. Few Questions were based on Operating System and<br/>
Networking.Very few quantitative & logic based questions were also there in this section.<br/>
Coding Section(60 min): There were 2 coding Questions. Questions were different for<br/>
everyone.Difficulty Level of the questions was easy/moderate.<br/>
I had one question related to prime numbers array and another question related to<br/>
lexicographically ordering of Strings.<br/>
(You can easily crack this round if you have some practice with competitive programming.)<br/>
<br/>
Round 2: Technical Interview<br/>
I was first asked to introduce myself. After this, I was asked technical questions as following:-<br/>
1) Object Oriented Programming Concepts with real life examples.<br/>
2) One String Based Coding Question using JAVA.<br/>
3) Searching & Sorting Algorithms.(Binary Search,Time & Space Complexities of Merge<br/>
Sort, Quick Sort,Heap Sort etc).<br/>
4) Some Questions related to JAVA Programming Concepts .<br/>
5) Joins in SQL (Given the tables and asked to write the Inner Join SQL Query)<br/>
After this I was asked questions based on my Projects (Since I had mentioned one DBMS<br/>
Project , I was asked to write/draw about all tables used in the Project) .<br/>
At the end , I was asked if I had any question for the interviewer. This round lasted for around<br/>
30-35 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Round 3 : HR Interview<br/>
This was a quite easy round. I was asked about Barclays Values (RISES) and some real life<br/>
examples of them. Then I was asked some general questions and about relocation etc.<br/>
At the end, I was asked if I had any Question for the interviewer.<br/>
14 students were selected for the internship.<br/>
Internship Experience(June 2020 - July 2020)<br/>
The internship was conducted virtually due to covid crisis.( Otherwise the Office Location is in<br/>
Kharadi,Pune). Interns had been offered Role as Graduate Intern at BUK . For project,Some<br/>
interns were grouped in a team of 3 members(Of same college) , some were individual and<br/>
some worked with their business teams. I was a part of 3 members team and we were assigned<br/>
an Interesting project- Data Masking and Refresh Utility. We got to work on technologies like<br/>
AngularJS,Spring Boot,RESTful Web Services,JDBC,SQL Server etc. Other teams projects<br/>
were also very interesting. You will get to learn and work on new technologies depending on<br/>
the project requirements. We were also assigned a technical guide for guidance related to the<br/>
project. Line Managers conduct the meetings (1 or 2 times) for tracking the progress of the<br/>
project and may give some suggestions in the project.<br/>
There were also some leadership,training and other interactive sessions from the higher<br/>
authorities and renowned personalities of the organisation during the internship.<br/>
After the project completion , all teams had to give a presentation on their respective projects.<br/>
(Presentation followed by Q&A session).<br/>
Pre-Placement Offer: Out of 14 students from our campus, 9 people were offered a PPO.<br/>
Based on the Presentation Performance and after conducting reviews with the line managers,<br/>
Students were given a Pre-Placement Offer.<br/>
Thus, Overall it was a very Nice Experience of Internship in Barclays.<br/>
<br/>
All The Very Best Guys!!<br/>
